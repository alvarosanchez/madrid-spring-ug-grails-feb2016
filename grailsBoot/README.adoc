= Spring Boot and Grails

This project aims to demonstrate that Grails sits on top of Spring Boot.

First have a look at `src/main/groovy/com/example/DemoApplication.groovy`. A raw Spring Boot application that you can
run with your IDE.

Grails comes with a slightly different main class, located at `grails-app/init/com/example/Application.groovy`.

Running any of them will make available any of the Spring Boot-registered endpoints, such as the `/health` endpoint.

Creating Grails controllers outside the convention-based directory `grails-app/controllers` is also possible. Have a look
in this case at `src/main/groovy/com/example/HomeController.groovy`.

== REST API

This REST API project is composed of:

* A `Todo` domain class.
* A `TodoController`.
* Some JSON views located at `grails-app/views/todo`.
